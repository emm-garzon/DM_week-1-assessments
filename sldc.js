// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning =
  "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";

const analysisOfRequirements =
  "Also referred to as 'requirements gathering', or 'requirements capturing', it is the process of defining user expectations for new software being built and/or modified.";

const design =
  "Using the requirements defined in the previous step, developers will outline the details for the overall application paying special attention to: User Interface, System Interface, Network requirements, and Database needs.";

const implementation =
  "Building on the customer requirements, and design documents authored in previous steps, the development team then proceeds to code/build the actual project.";

const testingIntegration =
  "With the software built, before the push into a production environment, developers must test their product ensuring that there aren't any bugs that will negatively affect the end-user experience. Bugs detected during this stage will be tracked, fixed, and later re-tested.";

const maintain =
  "After software is pushed into production, it is continually monitored for performance issues, and to ensure that it continues to meet user requirements as defined earlier in the process. If additional modifications are needed, its possible the development team may revisit the planning phase.";
